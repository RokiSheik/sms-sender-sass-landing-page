# SMS Sender — Landing Page

This repository contains a simple static landing page for an "SMS Sender" web project. The page is built with plain HTML and static assets (images) located in the `assets/img/` folder.

What you'll find
- `index.html` — the landing page markup.
- `assets/img/` — images used by the page (logo, banners, background, etc.).

Purpose
- Showcase the app or service with a clean, responsive hero section and visual assets.
- Provide a starting point for integrating a front-end with an SMS sending backend or API.

How to view locally
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (double-click the file or use your editor's "Open in Browser" feature).

Notes & next steps
- Add a CSS file or framework if you need styles separated from the HTML.
- Add a small JavaScript module to integrate with an SMS API (Twilio, Nexmo, etc.) when ready.
- Optimize images in `assets/img/` for faster page loads.
